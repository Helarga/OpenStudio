OpenStudio
==========

OpenStudio is a cross-platform (Windows, Mac, and Linux) collection of software tools to support whole building energy modeling using [EnergyPlus](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus) and advanced daylight analysis using [Radiance](https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/).  OpenStudio is an open source project to facilitate community development, extension, and private sector adoption.

The graphical applications include the OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in, OpenStudio Application, and the Parametric Analysis Tool. The SketchUp Plug-in and the Openstudio Application are maintained by the [OpenStudio Coalition](https://openstudiocoalition.org), which was founded to maintain and develop these graphical applications for the building energy modeling community.  The SketchUp Plug-in is an extension  to Trimbleâ€™s popular SketchUp 3D modeling tool that allows users to quickly create geometry needed for EnergyPlus.  Additionally, OpenStudio supports import of gbXML and IFC for geometry creation.  The OpenStudio       Application is a fully featured graphical interface to OpenStudio models including envelope, loads, schedules, and HVAC. ResultsViewer enables browsing, plotting, and comparing simulation output data, especially time   series.  The Parametric Analysis Tool enables studying the impact of applying multiple combinations of OpenStudio Measures to a base model as well as export of the analysis results for EDAPT submission.

The OpenStudio SDK allows building researchers and software developers to quickly get started through its multiple entry levels, including access through C++, Ruby, Python, and C#.

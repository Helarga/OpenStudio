# Overview

Following an important announcement related to future development of the OpenStudio Application released in September 2019 ([A Shift in BTO’s BEM Strategy: A New Future for the OpenStudio Application](https://www.openstudio.net/new-future-for-openstudio-application)), **this release marks the first installment of the separated OpenStudio SDK from the Application.**
Going forward, the SDK will continue to be distributed and released two times per year, in April and October. Development of the OpenStudioApplication has been moved to its own [NREL/OpenStudioApplication](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudioApplication/) GitHub.

Below is the list of components that is included in this SDK installer:

__**OpenStudio SDK 3.0.0**__
- EnergyPlus
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Radiance
- Ruby API
- C++ SDK

**Note** that [PAT](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT) is not included in either the SDK or Application installers. You will need to install PAT separately which is distributed on the [OpenStudio-PAT](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT) GitHub page.

## Long-Term Support of 2.x version: 2.9.X-LTS

This new major release is bringing a lot of changes not the least of which is the separation of the OpenStudioApplication as well as some API breaking changes.
Only critical bug-fixes will be implemented in the LTS branch and no new features will be developed. The supported EnergyPlus version will remain 9.2.0 in the LTS branch. We encourage users to transition to the 3.x version of OpenStudio.

# Installation Notes

OpenStudio 3.0.0 is supported on 64-bit Windows 7 – 10, OS X 10.12 – 10.15, and Ubuntu 18.04.

OpenStudio 3.0.0 supports [EnergyPlus Release 9.3](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/releases/tag/v9.3.0), which is bundled with the OpenStudio installer. It is no longer necessary to download and install EnergyPlus separately. Other builds of EnergyPlus are not supported by OpenStudio 3.0.0.

OpenStudio 3.0.0 supports Radiance 5.0.a.12, which is bundled with the OpenStudio installer; users no longer must install Radiance separately, and OpenStudio will use the included Radiance version regardless of any other versions that may be installed on the system. Other builds of Radiance are not supported by OpenStudio 3.0.0.

OpenStudio 3.x now uses **Ruby 2.5.5** as the supported version (2.2.4 previously).

As usual, you can refer to the **[OpenStudio Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/wiki/OpenStudio-Version-Compatibility-Matrix)** for more information.

## Installation Steps

- Download and install OpenStudio SDK and/or [OpenStudioApplication]( depending on your needs. Select components for installation. Note that OpenStudio Application is a standalone app and does not require you to install OpenStudio SDK.
- Setup a Building Component Library (BCL) account to access online building components and measures. View instructions on how to setup your account and configure the key in OpenStudio.
- The OpenStudio Application SketchUp Plug-in requires SketchUp 2019 (not available for Linux). The OpenStudio Application SketchUp Plug-in does not support older versions of SketchUp. SketchUp must be installed before OpenStudio Application to automatically activate the plugin. If you install SketchUp after OpenStudio Application, simply rerun the OpenStudio Application installer.

* ([#3044](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/issues/3044)) Added support for `FanSystemModel` to the Model API

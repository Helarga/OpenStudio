# Overview

As of April 2020, development and distribution of the OpenStudioApplication and the SketchUp plugin have transitioned to the OpenStudio Coalition, who is independently managing and distributing the software through its own [openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication) repository. The OpenStudio SDK is continuing to be actively developed and distributed by NREL and is released two times per year, through a spring and a fall release.

Below is the list of components that is included in this SDK installer:

__**OpenStudio SDK 3.7.0**__
- EnergyPlus
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Radiance
- Ruby API
- C++ SDK

**Note** that [PAT](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT) is not included in either the SDK or the OpenStudio Coalition's Application installers. You will need to install PAT separately which is distributed on the [OpenStudio-PAT](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT) GitHub page.

# Installation Notes

OpenStudio SDK 3.7.0 is supported on:

* 64-bit Windows 7 â€“ 11
* macOS: 10.15+ x86_64, 12.1+ arm64
* Ubuntu: 20.04 x86_64, 22.04 x86_64, 22.04 arm64
* Centos7

OpenStudio SDK 3.7.0 supports [EnergyPlus Release 23.2.0](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/releases/tag/v23.2.0), which is bundled with the OpenStudio installer. It is no longer necessary to download and install EnergyPlus separately. Other builds of EnergyPlus are not supported by OpenStudio SDK 3.7.0.

OpenStudio SDK 3.7.0 supports Radiance 5.0.a.12, which is bundled with the OpenStudio installer; users no longer must install Radiance separately, and OpenStudio will use the included Radiance version regardless of any other versions that may be installed on the system. Other builds of Radiance are not supported by OpenStudio SDK 3.7.0.

As usual, you can refer to the **[OpenStudio SDK Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/wiki/OpenStudio-SDK-Version-Compatibility-Matrix)** for more information.


## Installation Steps

- Download and install [OpenStudio SDK](https://github.com/NREL/openstudio) and/or [openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication) depending on your needs. Select components for installation. Note that OpenStudio Application is a standalone app and does not require you to install OpenStudio SDK.
- Setup a Building Component Library (BCL) account to access online building components and measures. View instructions on how to setup your account and configure the key in OpenStudio.
- The OpenStudio Application SketchUp Plug-in requires SketchUp 2021-2022 (not available for Linux). The OpenStudio Application SketchUp Plug-in does not support older versions of SketchUp. SketchUp must be installed before OpenStudio Application to automatically activate the plugin. If you install SketchUp after OpenStudio Application, simply re-run the OpenStudio Application installer.

# OpenStudio SDK:

The 3.7.0 is a **major** release. This update includes several new features, performance improvements, and bug fixes.

## C++ Workflow code

As of OpenStudio SDK 3.7.0 a re-written workflow written in C++ is used by default in place of the Ruby based Workflow Gem that had been used in the past. This enhancement is in support of Python measures being used in an OpenStudio workflow, including mixed language workflows that include both Ruby Measures and Python Measures. If you need to use the older Workflow Gem implementation, you can do that by using the `classic` subcommand after `openstudio`. `classic` will be deprecated in a future version of OpenStudio. 

## Python Bindings

As of OpenStudio SDK 3.2.0, Python bindings are officially supported and distributed through Python Package Index (PyPI). To install, users will need to have Python3 installed along with pip and simply run the following command in a terminal window.

`pip install openstudio==3.7.0`

Please see [openstudio on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/openstudio/) for further instructions on how to install. Users can also visit the test channel at [openstudio on TestPyPi](https://test.pypi.org/project/openstudio/) to install development bindings.

You can also refer to the [OpenStudio SDK Python Binding Version Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/wiki/OpenStudio-SDK-Python-Binding-Version-Compatibility-Matrix) to see the list of supported platforms and python versions.

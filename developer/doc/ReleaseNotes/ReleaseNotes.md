# Overview
As of April 2020, development and distribution of the OpenStudioApplication and the SketchUp plugin have transitioned to the OpenStudio Coalition, who is independently managing and distributing the software through its own [openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication) repository. The OpenStudio SDK is continuing to be actively developed and distributed by NREL and is released two times per year, through a spring and a fall release.

Below is the list of components that is included in this SDK installer:

__**OpenStudio SDK 3.4.1**__
- EnergyPlus
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Radiance
- Ruby API
- C++ SDK

**Note** that [PAT](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT) is not included in either the SDK or the OpenStudio Coalition's Application installers. You will need to install PAT separately which is distributed on the [OpenStudio-PAT](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT) GitHub page.

`pip install openstudio==3.4.1`

**New in 3.4.1: Python bindings for macOS arm64 (M1 mac) are now provided on Pypi**

## New Features, Major Fixes and API-breaking changes

* [#4589](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4589) - Switch to E+ Space FT by default
    * OpenStudio SDK 3.3.0 added support to the new EnergyPlus 9.6.0 [space concept](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/blob/develop/design/FY2021/NFP-Spaces.md). This was an opt-in feature, as it was disabled by default.
    * This is now enabled by default. You can opt-out by by manually calling `ForwardTranslator::setExcludeSpaceTranslation(true)` before calling `ForwardTranslator::translateModel(Model&)` or passing the CLI argument `--no-space-translation` to the `run` method (eg: `openstudio run --no-space-translation -w workflow.osw`)
    * As a reminder, a few limitations due to DaylightingControls/IlluminanceMap exist: in case one of these objects is found in a ThermalZone, spaces will be combined for that ThermalZone (historical behavior)
